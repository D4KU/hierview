# hierview
This in a tiny image viewer for a very specific use case: if your images are
organized in numbered directories like this, then it allows you to quickly
switch between different levels of hierarchies:

```
- project_145
    - camera_0
        - frame_0001.jpg
        - frame_0002.jpg
    - camera_1
        - frame_0001.jpg
        - frame_0002.jpg
```
